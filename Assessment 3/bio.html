        <h1>Ocean Vuong</h1>    
        <p class="paragraph-1">
            After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family marked by the experiences of war and exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer, profoundly shaped his imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to learn how to read and write.
            He studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English from Brooklyn College, followed by an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.
