## Artistic Statement 🔗
This project critiques how surveillance capitalism profiles users, shapes behavior, and monetizes emotion. By putting the viewer through a playful-yet-unsettling digital ritual—interrogations, glitches, false personalization, distraction—the experience mirrors real digital ecosystems that collect data to manipulate users.

EXØS aims to reveal these hidden systems and empower viewers to resist, reflect, and reclaim agency.
