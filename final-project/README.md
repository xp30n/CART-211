## Artistic Statement 💾
This project critiques how surveillance capitalism profiles users, shapes behavior, and monetizes emotion. By putting the viewer through a playful yet strange digital ritual interrogations, glitches, false personalization, distraction—the experience mirrors real digital ecosystems that collect data to manipulate users.
