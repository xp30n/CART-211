        <h1>Ocean Vuong</h1>
        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-1">
          After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class
          family marked by the experiences of war and exile. His mother, an
          illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer,
          profoundly shaped his imagination and relationship with language.
          Vuong was the first in his family to learn how to read and write. He
          studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A.
          in English from Brooklyn College, followed by an M.F.A. in creative
          writing at New York University.

        <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-2">
          His first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with
          the collection Night Sky with Exit Wounds (2016) that he gained
          international recognition. His poetry explores themes of the Vietnam
          War’s legacy, migration, queer identity, and the fragility of
          language. In 2019, he published his debut novel, On Earth We’re
          Briefly Gorgeous, widely acclaimed by critics. Written as a letter to
          his illiterate mother, the book intertwines autobiography, family
          history, and reflections on sexuality, race, and inherited trauma. In
          2022, he released Time Is a Mother, a poetry collection shaped by
          mourning his mother’s death and an even more intimate exploration of
          grief and survival. Ocean Vuong currently teaches literature and
          creative writing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
